# python-challenge
this repositry contains two sub-directories. One is for the bank challenge and the other is for the poll challenge. In each of these sub-directories, there is a main.py file that uses data from a Resource subdirectory and writes output both to the screen and to a text file in an analysis subdirecotry. 

Code sources in addition to class information include:
pythontutorial.net (writing to a text file);
pynative.com (writing a list to a file);
programiz.com (finding max in a list);
